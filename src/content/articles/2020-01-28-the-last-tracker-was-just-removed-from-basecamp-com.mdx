>Can you believe we used to willingly tell Google about every single visitor to basecamp.com by way of Google Analytics? Letting them collect every last byte of information possible through the spying eye of their tracking pixel. Ugh.
<br /><br />
But 2020 isn't 2010. Our naiveté around data, who captures it, and what they do with it has collectively been brought to shame. Most people now sit with basic understanding that using the internet leaves behind a data trail, and quite a few people have begun to question just how deep that trail should be, and who should have the right to follow it.
<br /><br />
In this new world, it feels like an obligation to make sure we're not aiding and abetting those who seek to exploit our data. Those who hoard every little clue in order to piece of together a puzzle that'll ultimately reveal all our weakest points and moments, then sell that picture to the highest bidder.
<br /><br />
The internet needs to know less about us, not more. Just because it's possible to track someone doesn't mean we should.**<a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-last-tracker-was-just-removed-from-basecamp-com/#comments">The last tracker was just removed from Basecamp.com</a>**

I just started using <a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/ZTSEBE">Fathom</a> for this particular reason. While it does cost (as opposed to Google Analytics that people refer to as 'free'), it's not much unless your website has millions of visitors (which in that case, good for you!). Give your website visitors a treat and switch from Google Analytics today.
