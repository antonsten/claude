>Two of the workers said they picked up what they believe was a sexual assault. When something like that happens, they may share the experience in the internal chat room as a way of relieving stress.

## What is the right thing to do?
It's a difficult moral dilemma to attack and it's (yet another) great example of why it's so crucial for designers (and the rest of the team) to have a clear <a href="/ai-ethics/">set of ethics</a>.

The tools we're building are no longer just 'gimmicks', they are integrated into our personal (and private) lives on a level that we've never seen in society before. Sure, adding things to your shopping list through voice is great but as long as the company that's listening in is in the business of 'personal data', don't be naive and think they'll only record the shopping list.  

I'm becoming increasingly terrified over the fact that there is no real debate around this on a national - and global - level. We're just letting the big 5 continue to hoard our data and then get upset over the fact that they sell it.
