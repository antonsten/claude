>Our vacation policy is “take vacation.” We don’t have any rules or forms around how many weeks per year. Frankly, we intermix work and personal time quite a bit, doing email at odd hours, taking off weekday afternoons for kids’ games, etc. Our leaders make sure they set good examples by taking vacations, often coming back with fresh ideas, and encourage the rest of the team to do the same.<br /><br />You might think that such freedom would lead to chaos. But we also don’t have a clothing policy, yet no one has come to work naked. The lesson is you don’t need policies for everything. Most people understand the benefit of wearing clothes at work.**<a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">Netflix Culture</a>**

After browsing the original <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/2-Netflix_CultureFreedom_Responsibility2">Netflix Culture</a> slidedeck and reading the updated <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">Netflix Culture</a> page on their site, Netflix entered one of the few companies that could inspire me to take on a full time position. I love it!
