>Buying things is more fun than running, which is why I convinced myself that an Apple Watch was the perfect inspiration to get back into my trainers. It is now a few months on—I’m still not running regularly, but the watch provided a different and unexpected benefit. I can now leave the house without my phone and still maintain a line of connection to the world with messages, email, and maps. It is freeing. I have no social media on the watch, so no snares in which to get stuck in idle moments. It’s a tremendous relief to be free of the drag of demented global consciousness, and I predict that many others will find the appeal of this situation.**<a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2019/leave-the-phone-at-home/">Leave the Phone at Home</a>**

I have just got my hands on an all-new iPhone 11 Pro but this makes me really wanting the Apple Watch.
