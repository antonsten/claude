>I took a Facebook vacation about a year ago. It became a long break. And now it is a permanent vacation. Why? Because I don't need it and don't miss it. I left, not because of the company's dodgy approach to privacy, data accumulation or its continued denial of its impact on shaping modern society. I left because it was making me someone I am not — someone who lives life through the eyes of others. There is a hard edge in Facebook life. People are always fronting — putting their best life forward. Just like startup life these days. **<a href="https://om.co/2018/09/01/the-long-goodbye-to-facebook/" target="_blank">The Long Goodbye (To Facebook)</a>**

No single decision I've made in the last year has had a more positive effect on my life than <a href="/byefacebook/">deleting my Facebook account</a>. I'm down to checking in on Instagram every 2 or 3 days and I think before the end of the year I will have deleted the app from my phone (I've already moved it off my home screen).
