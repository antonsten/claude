>Technology can help you a lot, but if technology gains too much power over your life, you might become a hostage to its agenda. Thousands of years ago, humans invented agriculture, but this technology enriched just a tiny elite, while enslaving the majority of humans. Most people found themselves working from sunrise till sunset plucking weeds, carrying water buckets and harvesting corn under a blazing sun. It can happen to you too.

Technology isn't bad. If you know what you want in life, technology can help you get it. But if you don't know what you want in life, it will be all too easy for technology to shape your aims for you and take control of your life. Especially as technology gets better at understanding humans, you might increasingly find yourself serving it, instead of it serving you.** <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/yuval-noah-harari-extract-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century?utm_source=offscreenmag_com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter" target="_blank">Yuval Noah Harari on what the year 2050 has in store for humankind</a> **

I'm a huge fan of both Sapiens and Homo Deus and from this article, Yuval Noah Harari's next book seems like another hit.
