>Davidson’s extremely detailed posts get at a core issue of the privacy debate, which is that none of this invasive technology happens by accident. Our privacy crisis is a crisis of design. Take that telling line from Vohra, Superhuman’s C.E.O., which is less than a week old and has already aged poorly. We did not consider potential bad actors. But, as Davidson goes on to explain, Superhuman did receive negative feedback about email tracking; it just didn’t listen. “We did not consider” doesn’t mean the company was unaware but that they didn’t seem to take the feedback into consideration.**<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/opinion/internet-privacy-project.html">NYT Privacy Project Newsletter</a>**
