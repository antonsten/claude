>Among the most mind-boggling allegations in Hertz's filed complaint is that Accenture didn't incorporate a responsive design, in which webpages automatically resize to accommodate the visitor's screen size whether they are using a phone, tablet, desktop, or laptop.

That has been standard website practice for years and was even included in the contract that was signed, but the boffins at Accenture decided that only desktop and mobile versions were needed, according to Hertz. When the rental giant's execs asked where the tablet version was, Accenture "demanded hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional fees to deliver the promised medium-sized layout.”**<a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/23/hertz_accenture_lawsuit/">Accenture sued $32m+ over website redesign for Hertz</a>**

I guess this means bigger is not (by default) better then, no?
