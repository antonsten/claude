As creators in the digital age, we often face moral dilemmas that weren't part of the conversation just a few years ago. One of these pressing questions is: Do we have a responsibility to choose platforms that align with our values?

This question has become increasingly relevant as major platforms like Twitter and Substack face scrutiny over their content moderation policies and ethical stances. The exodus of users from Twitter following Elon Musk's acquisition, with reports suggesting up to 20% of users leaving the platform since the US election, highlights how these concerns are reshaping the digital landscape.

Respected journalist Walt Mossberg's powerful statement, "I don't hang out in Nazi bars," encapsulates the moral clarity some have found in making these decisions. It's a stark reminder that our choice of platforms isn't just about functionality or reach – it's about the company we keep and the values we endorse.

But here's where it gets complicated: Substack, despite similar controversies around content moderation, continues to see growth. Many writers choose it for its promise of audience growth and monetization potential. This creates a tension between practical business interests and ethical considerations.

### The small creator's dilemma

As someone who isn't a major influencer or content creator, it's easy to think our platform choices don't matter. "I'm too small to make a difference," we might tell ourselves. But perhaps that's exactly why these choices matter more than ever. When enough small voices make ethical choices, it creates a collective impact.

### Making conscious platform choices

* Consider platforms' governance structures (Are they profit-driven companies or non-profit foundations?)
* Evaluate their content moderation policies and track record
* Think about the long-term implications of supporting certain platforms

In my case, this reflection led me to choose Ghost, a distributed non-profit foundation, for my website and newsletter. For social media presence, I've moved to Bluesky, a platform that better align with my values. These weren't just technical decisions – they were ethical ones.

### The Bigger Picture

Every platform choice we make as creators is a small vote for the kind of internet we want to see. While it might seem inconvenient or potentially limiting to avoid certain platforms, we must ask ourselves: At what point does convenience become complicity?

This isn't about perfect purity – it's about making conscious choices with the information we have. As creators, we have the power to shape not just what we create, but how and where we share it. Perhaps it's time we embraced that responsibility more fully.
