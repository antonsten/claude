>At best, it was inconvenient to explain the situation to potential guests. At worst, potential guests might have suspected some kind of scheme. By design, Airbnb mines your history to build your profile, and that's incredibly problematic for transgender people who've established a new life.

Changing your name on a profile might be problematic and occasionally impossible. Changing your gender could possibly just be a dropdown but to have it reflect that change on the entire site takes commitment. Well done Airbnb.
