Although I quite recently touched the subject of <a href="/freelancer-for-life/">staying small</a>, I thought this <a href="http://blog.offscreenmag.com/post/121231474961/on-growth" target="_blank">blog post</a> from Offscreen was too great not to mention.

Here's a great excerpt but you should really head over and read the entire thing:

I love going back to an essay in issue No7 titled “Human Scale”, written by fellow Australian and Icelab co-founder Michael Honey. He writes:

> ‘It doesn’t scale’ is a criticism levelled at many new ideas. (…) But how many things which are good when small get better by becoming bigger? (…) Humans are good at family, middling at community, dysfunctional as nations, and self-destructive as a planet. What doesn’t scale is our ability to relate to each other as human beings instead of target markets — as eyeballs to monetise.

And then there is this <a href="http://99u.com/articles/36587/ugmonk-jeffsheldon-interview-the-beauty-in-keeping-things-small" target="_blank">recent interview with Jeff Sheldon</a> of Ugmonk fame in which he talks about being proud of staying small:

> “We’re not growing a hockey-stick growth, but we’re growing enough. We’re building that fan base and are in it for the long haul, so I’m able to keep it really small and handle every part of the business or almost every part of the business, which does limit me on the creative side sometimes. I can’t release a hundred products every year. I can’t speak at dozens of conferences. I have to limit everything I do. (…) But I’m okay with all those things right now. I choose to keep it small, to keep it lean, to keep this business profitable where it is. (…) I’m much more focused on building that tribe of core followers that cares about what I do, than having ten thousand, one hundred thousand, or one million people that kind of like the cool shirt today, and then they totally forget about it tomorrow.”

So here I am, working long days (and sometimes sleepless nights) to make a thing with a growth trajectory slightly more optimistic than the mom-and-pop shop down the road. And I’m finally ok with it. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind growing, but I do mind growing for <a href="http://www.offscreenmag.com/values/" target="_blank">growth’s sake</a>, which is what seems to happen a lot with tech companies these days.
