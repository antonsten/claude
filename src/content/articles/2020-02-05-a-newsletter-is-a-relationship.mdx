>For me, the most significant insight was to understand that a newsletter was a relationship — a chance to serve. Not just to sell.
<br /><br />
An example.
<br /><br />
You have two friends. One who calls you and always wants something. Then the other friend, who just calls to see how you are, and tells you about a film you would love or a podcast you should listen to.
<br /><br />
Now, when you are busy, and the phone rings, who do you always take the call from?
<br /><br />
We all know the answer.
<br /><br />
So why does that matter? Because our competition is not another brand, but the fact that our customer is busy. **<a href="https://www.dolectures.online/email-for-growth">E-mail for growth</a>**
