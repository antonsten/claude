>A good design review:<br />
— Very briefly allows the designer to introduce their work. One or two minutes tops, honestly.<br />
— Establishes boundaries for the desired type of feedback. Where are they in the process? What kind of feedback is most helpful — high-level or more granular? Is this production-ready, or early conceptual thinking?<br />
— Lets the reviewers do most of the talking. The presenter does not get a rebuttal unless it’s in the form of a question.<br />
— Allows for more in-depth follow ups where there are more probing questions or issues of work overlap.**<a href="https://modus.medium.com/humans-first-strategies-for-leading-remote-design-teams-d08df0c3f662">The Ultimate Guide to Leading a Remote Design Team</a>**
