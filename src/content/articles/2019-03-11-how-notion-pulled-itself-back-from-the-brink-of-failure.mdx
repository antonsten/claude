>It was around that time we noticed Ivan in Figma. He suddenly popped to the top of our most active user list — spending upwards of 18+ hours a day in our design tool. As we’d later find out, he was designing frenetically and barely sleeping, pumping out version after version of a new app that would become Notion 1.0.**<a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-on-a-deadline-how-notion-pulled-itself-back-from-the-brink-of-failure/">How Notion pulled itself back from the brink of failure</a>**

At first I was just surprised to see Figma so openly saying they have a "list of our most active users" - and that they keep track of it. On a more general level, I'm sceptic to articles like this that celebrate Notion's success through "working 18+ hours a day".
