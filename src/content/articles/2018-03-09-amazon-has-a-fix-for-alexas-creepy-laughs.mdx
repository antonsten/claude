>Over the past few days, users with Alexa-enabled devices have reported hearing strange, unprompted laughter. Amazon responded to the creepiness in a statement to The Verge, saying, “We’re aware of this and working to fix it.”
<br /><br />As noted in media reports and a trending Twitter moment, Alexa laughs without being prompted to wake. People on Twitter and Reddit reported that they thought it was an actual person laughing near them, which can be scary when you’re home alone. Many responded to the cackling sounds by unplugging their Alexa-enabled devices.**<a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/7/17092334/amazon-alexa-devices-strange-laughter"> - Amazon has a fix for Alexa’s creepy laughs</a>**

Let's add that to the list of things that Alexa can do that the HomePod can't. I've read reports from people investing into this even further and none of the laughs you can trigger (_Alexa, can you laugh?_), triggers this evil grinning laugh. If I've had an Alexa that would do this I would definitely unplug it (and never plug it back in). What if <a href="/voiceinput">your smart assistant</a> did this? You would send them for a psychical checkup.
