>In the space of 24 hours, a pair of English clubs considered dead on the mat somehow lifted themselves to improbable victories. If you did, you won’t forget them. If you merely know someone who watched them, a warning: They are never going to stop talking about them.**<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theres-no-crazy-like-soccer-crazy-11557408560?tesla=y">There’s no crazy like soccer crazy</a>**

I normally don't write about my second big passion in life, Liverpool, here but I'll make an exception because of the amazing come back against Barcelona last Tuesday. I watched the second leg of the game in a hotel room in France. I was almost ready to tell my wife that we might as well go out to dinner, that there's no way they'll come back from a 3-0 defeat. But they did and it was one of the best Liverpool experiences I've had in a long time (anyone familiar with the club know that the last years have had their... downs).

You'll never walk alone.
