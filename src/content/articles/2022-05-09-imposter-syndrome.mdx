This <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2022/04/26/coyiers-law/">post from Chris Coyier</a> resonated (I'll save you a click, it reads: *"The effort-to-engagement ratio for content is unguessable."*) with me, so I'll follow his lead;

Last week I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/Mr_Bingo/status/1522486762156740608">tweet from Mr. Bingo</a> that I've been thinking about. I can't possibly stress how true this is. Perhaps even worse for us "seniors" is that we tend to believe that we're the only senior creatives that feel this way. Starting a new role earlier this year in a new industry, I've experienced this more often lately.

It also reminds me of a creative I met at Herman Miller who had never heard of nor experienced the concept of imposter syndrome, and I thought, what a life you must have had.
