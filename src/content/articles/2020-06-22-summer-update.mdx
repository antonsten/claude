There's no new post this week. Why? Because it's summer and I have been prioritizing regaining strength after a year of intense work (not mentioning a pandemic). Instead, I wanted to give you three updates:

## 1. Pick my brain re-opens in the fall!
I've had a couple of requests for work just like this in the last weeks so starting August, you can get access to me on a short-term basis. Do you want to bounce ideas for a product? Do you want to accelerate UX within your organisation? Or do *you* want to personally accelerate? Either way, I'm open for consulting! Find out more and book your spot: <a href="/course/">Pick my brain</a>

## 2. Let's meet!
One of the few positives of not having a dog with me at work anymore (😢) is I'm far more flexible when it comes to traveling. So if you want to schedule something in-person for the fall, I'm open for it! That could be a workshop where we define the core features of your product or a review of your current product along with a time plan of necessary fixes going forward. While I love working remotely, some meetings are better in person. <a href="mailto:anton@antonsten.com">E-mail me!</a>

## 3. Tell me what you want, what you really really want
I've written my blog for nearly 7 years and had this newsletter for just about as long. There's still a few of you here from the very beginning - thank you - although I think I may have forced you to join. Care to help me continue providing you with insights? <a href="https://ooto.typeform.com/to/EJku4B">Answer these quick questions (less than 2 minutes)!</a>

I'll be back with a new post in about a month or so. Until then, I hope you're having a great summer and taking time to just... breathe again. If you want to tell me or ask me anything, just hit reply. I respond to every email 😃
