>The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer. If our customer was our product, we could make a ton of money. We’ve elected not to do that. <br /><br />
Our products are iPhones and iPads and Macs and HomePods and the Watch, et cetera, and if we can convince you to buy one, we’ll make a little bit of money, right? But you are not our product.
<br /><br />
You are our customer. You are a jewel, and we care about the user experience. And we’re not going to traffic in your personal life. I think it’s an evasion of privacy. I think it’s – privacy to us is a human right.**<a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/4/6/17197754/watch-apple-ceo-tim-cook-msnbc">Tim Cook - We care about the user experience</a>**

There's been a lot of complaints about the lack of features in Siri compared to it's counter parts primarily Alexa and Google Assistant. The big difference is of course that while Amazon and Google make their profits of it's users (and hence need the data you provide), Apple is not in that game. Long term, I think it's becoming clear to us that the path that Apple has chosen, is the one that's going to last. And like Tim mentions in the final seconds of the clip: _"This is not something we just started doing because we saw something last week. We've been doing this for years."_
