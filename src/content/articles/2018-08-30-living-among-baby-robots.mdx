>"The real problem is that the car is too safe, they have to learn to be aggressive in the right amount." Even more difficult, they must understand the complex, local culture of driving in each location.** <a href="https://char.gd/recharged/daily/living-among-baby-robots" target="_blank">How I kicked my email compulsion</a> **

Even most humans have trouble understanding and adapting to local culture of driving. Driving in Sweden is very different from driving in just Italy or France. The Middle East or even the US is something entirely different too. Thinking that driving patterns for a self-driving car could be linear is as naive as thinking that every user of your product thinks and acts in the same way.
