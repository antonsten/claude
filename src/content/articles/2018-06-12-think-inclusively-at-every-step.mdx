>Ethics are not just an afterthought, add-on, or checklist to fill out at the end of a project. In all development and use of technology, we will consider the broader social context of our products and services, and make this consideration part of our ethos. This means not only thinking about diversity of race, gender, and class, but also taking into account environmental, social, and psychological impacts. Thinking inclusively is creatively cross-disciplinary; it involves not just the sciences but also the arts.**<a href="https://canadianinnovationspace.ca/tech-for-good/">Think inclusively at every step</a>**

Speaking of <a href="/moral-implications-apps">ethics....</a> The Canadian tech community is leading the way with an open declaration for using technology for good. I love this!
