>It wasn’t until things had calmed down a bit and the medics asked her about whether I’d been drinking, and if I was taking any medication, that she walked off for a moment to go inside the house.
<br />
In an instant, she was hurrying back towards us with a determined look in her eye and a large plastic bag in her hands.
<br /><br />
“This is what he’s taking,” she said, holding out the bag filled with prescription bottles.
<br /><br />
Everyone looked down at all the different medications in there, and then just kind of remained silent for a second.
<br />
“Which one?” someone asked, finally. “Which of these has he taken today.”
<br /><br />
And Joanie, she just looked at the guy for a moment, and then she pointed into the bag.
<br />
“Everything,” she said. “Everything in here. This whole bag.”**<a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/clint-malarchuk-bleeding-out">Bleeding Out</a>**
