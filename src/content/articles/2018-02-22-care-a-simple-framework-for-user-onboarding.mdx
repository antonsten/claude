>All too often, onboarding is a finite project that's owned by a single team (probably product or growth) and has a due date. It's shipped, checked off the roadmap and everyone moves on to the next project. This is absolutely the wrong way to treat your onboarding.<br /><br />Onboarding must be a continual process for your business.
That's because onboarding is not a project or a feature – it needs to be an ongoing concern, a mission, a mindset, a strategy that needs to adapt over time as your product and business evolve. It must be a continual process for your business and your customers.<br /><br />As your business grows and gets different types of customers, your onboarding will need to adapt. You'll never be "finished" working on onboarding. And even your most loyal and active customers need to be continually onboarded to new areas of your product.
