This <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/time-traveler">fascinating tool from Merriam Webster</a>, let's you see when a word was first used in print.

1981 (when I was born) includes words like: graphical user interface, LAN, screen saver, uninstall and unsubscribe but also autocorrect which I would have assumed was only used far later.
