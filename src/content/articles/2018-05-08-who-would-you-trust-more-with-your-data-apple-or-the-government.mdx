The question is who could be trusted to be the central repository for personal data? The piece suggests that governments, Google, Amazon and Apple could all be candidates.**<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/07/privacy-poll-apple-government/">Who would you trust more with your data, Apple or the government?</a>**

It's an interesting topic and one that I think we should have a more open and serious discussion about. Given that the poll is on 9to5Apple, a website that mainly attracts Apple supporters, the results are biased but it's still interesting that Apple scores 87% of the votes while the government is below 3%, ahead of Google (1.6%) and Amazon (0.5%). I'm not even sure the people that voted for Amazon are serious, if they are I would love to hear their argument.

I have no doubts that neither Apple nor the government would ever sell my data so for me it's merely a case of who I think would have better security measurements in place. iCloud was hacked years ago but so has most governments. With Google and Amazon, I'm 100% confident that they would sell the data, or at least misuse it.
