> "The two minds—the experience designer and the planner—are so important because as I look for pain points and things that will add value over time, the planners look for dissonance and interesting elements that will stand out. By combining these two mind-sets, we're looking for patterns and dissonance together. It gets really juicy and really interesting."

I do share her reasoning that different types of people (roles) will look for different solutions and pain points. Different perspectives on the same problem should ideally give a more thought through solution.

However, I think it's clear from the quote that R/GA's blood is marketing rather than product design.

From a product design perspective I'm trying to create an experience without elements that stand out but rather a seamless, simple and efficient solution. People that use products daily want things that just work &#8211; not things that stand out and create fraction against the rest of the experience.
