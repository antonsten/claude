>When I recently logged into my Mailchimp account, I quickly got frustrated trying to navigate my way around all the things I didn’t want to do. Even more off-putting than dealing with the usability challenges of feature bloat are the constant little hints that <a href="https://twitter.com/KaiBrach/status/1263225673251868672">I’m not doing enough</a>.
<br /><br />
Mailchimp keeps telling me to “boost sales with shoppable landing pages and social media ads”. With every update, Dropbox reminds me that it needs access to my calendar, so I can make full use of “the world’s first smart workspace”. Seemingly every week, Adobe notifies me about some new cloud feature that will “enhance my creativity”.**<a href="https://www.densediscovery.com/issues/93">Dense Discovery Issue 93</a>**

As much as I'd like to love Mailchimp, I've been experiencing this a lot lately too. What used to be a great product with an amazing brand is now a product filled with banners trying to get me to share my newsletter on Instagram or sell something off Facebook. I understand why, I'm just saying it's not for me.

<a href="https://www.gosquared.com">GoSquared</a>, another company I really like, is heading down the same path with marketing automations and a light-weight CRM.

<a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> are seemingly heading down this route too - charging more for bits and pieces here and there. Again, I understand why, I just wish... they wouldn't. 

I've already ditched Dropbox and Adobe due to primarily these reasons. I sincerely hope the companies and products I love, like <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> and <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> will continue to do one thing, and do it well.
