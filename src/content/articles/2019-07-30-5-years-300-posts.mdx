One of the things I always try to push right away with new or potential clients is that I'm just a one-man company. That means more personal service and better communication. If you call me, I'll be the one answering (please email unless it's super urgent though). So I figured it's time to give some personal updates here too.

Lately, I've been thinking a lot about the future of my work. On a general level - what will be the requirements for the <a href="/uxdesigner/">UX designer</a> or <a href="/uxlead/">UX lead</a> of tomorrow? It seems like it's been ages since we all agreed that voice is the future, but I'm not sure if we're any closer to that future at all? (<a href="/future-ux-designer/">The Future of the UX-Designer (2017)</a>, <a href="/hey-siri-whats-the-future-of-user-interfaces/">Hey Siri, what's the future of user interfaces (2015)</a> and <a href="/voiceinput/">Voice Input is the Next Big Thing - Or is It? (2018)</a>)

On a personal level, what is the kind of work I want to do? I think any senior designer have thought along these same lines from time to time... "Will I still be doing websites 20 years from now?" "Do I have the motivation for *another* 20 years?" "How do I want to work?" "Do I have other options?" (<a href="/avengers/">Let's assemble like the Avengers and... do work (2019)</a>)

During the past year, I've been doing somewhat different kind of work for IKEA, leading a team and focusing on aligning people and deliverables rather than designing or focusing on features. I realized that it's not exactly the kind of work I wanted to do, but, in hindsight, I'm really grateful for the experience and the insight it brought. It brings to mind a quote from <a href="https://www.kaleighmoore.com">Kaleigh Moore</a> from <a href="/books/masteringfreelance">Mastering Freelance</a>:

>Everyone’s path is going to be different, but I think one of the best ways you can find your purpose is by doing a lot of things you DON’T like. I had a few jobs and internships in college that made me realize what things I absolutely did not want to be doing--so getting those experiences, even while they weren’t fun at the time--were important.**<a href="https://www.kaleighmoore.com">Kaleigh Moore</a>**

Since then I've begun working with <a href="http://superfriend.ly">Superfriendly</a>. I reached out to my friend <a href="http://danmall.me">Dan</a> to talk to him about <a href="/avengers/">my idea of a new type of consultancy</a>. If you want to grow as a designer, as a developer or whatever it's really important to surround yourself with the best people out there. This is easy to dismiss because you don't have the power to change your co-worker's skills. However, you CAN always try and find other, better co-workers. Working with people who are better than you is the easiest way to grow your skills and makes work a whole lot more fun!

I'm planning some traveling in August (Biarritz, France), September (Antibes, France), and October (Toronto, Canada) as I haven't really had any time off at all since last summer. I was in Boston for a few days in the beginning of July and traveling is such a great way to find inspiration through reflection. (<a href="/built-to-last/">Built to last (2016)</a>)

A good sign that it's soon to be fall is that I've begun thinking about doing a minor update on the design of my website. This time, I'm thinking both of features and visual design (and less about technology). (<a href="/redesign/">A Redesign</a> (2017) and <a href="/newdesign/">I've redesigned my website and it looks exactly the same</a> (2019)) I also want to get back into more long-form writing this fall. I've had a bit of a lack of inspiration lately and, to be honest, it's felt more like something I have to do rather than something I want to do. I have an idea where I would publish one article a day for a month. It sounds like a fun challenge! (<a href="/designers-write/">Why Designers Need to Write (2017)</a>

The other week I ran a small ad for <a href="https://antonsten.com/books/user-experiences-matter/">User Experiences that Matter</a> in <a href="https://www.densediscovery.com">Dense Discovery</a>, an excellent newsletter that I think you should subscribe to if you aren't already. It performed really well and I sold more than 10 books in a single day (which is about what I normally sell in a month). Yay! You can still get 20% off using the code 'DENSE'.
