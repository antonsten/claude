>What you do today does impact your future.<br />
Do you eat junk food?
I’ll tell you this: In 10 years you’ll be fatter and unhealthier.
<br />
Do you complain?
I’ll tell you this: Your life’s situation will be exactly the same in 10 years.
<br />
Do you lounge in your office chair all day and watch YouTube videos instead of doing hard things?
I’ll tell you this: You’ll be stuck at that same job. Or worse, you’ll get fired.
<br />
Do you spend more than you earn?
I’ll tell you this: In 10 years, you’ll worry about money every single day.
<br />
Obviously, I’m not a fortune teller. But this predicting is easy. Anyone with a little common sense can do it. And it works like a charm.

Great post from <a href="http://dariusforoux.com/how-to-predict-your-future/">Darius Foroux</a>. Same common sense goes for building a great business.
