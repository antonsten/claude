>Lots of freelancers don't really understand what the word "consultant" means.
<br />
It might be because they heard that they should stop calling themselves "freelancers" and start calling themselves "consultants", and assumed it was merely a semantic difference.
<br />
A freelancer is a mercenary.
<br />
A consultant is an advisor.
<br />
Mercenaries do as they're told.
<br />
Advisors answer questions when asked.
<br />
It's a big difference.**<a href="https://jonathanstark.com/daily">Jonathan Stark</a>**
