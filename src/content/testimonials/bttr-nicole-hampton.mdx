  - "We all have that person whom we want to book for every project. Anton is that person for me. He's experienced, insightful, collaborative, and great at his craft. He's an unusual mix of both a leader and mentor for the creative team while also building a strong relationship with the client, asking questions, and understanding the needs and motivations of their users. The resulting work is always well-considered and exceeds expectations."
