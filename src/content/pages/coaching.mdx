# Coaching

I've spent the past 25+ years designing apps and websites for companies like Google, Spotify, Loom, IKEA, and Herman Miller. I've worked with big agencies like BBDO and Bates Y&R, teamed up with startups (some you've heard of, most you haven't), published two books, coached over 100 students and designers, and spoken at design schools for more than 15 years.

Along the way, I've picked up a few things about design, careers, and how to stay sane while building both.

If you're stuck, growing, or just figuring out what's next, here's how I can help:

<section className="space-y-12 mb-24">
  {coachingOptions.map(option => (
    <div key={option.title} className="space-y-4">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">{option.title}</h3>
      <p className="body-lg">{option.description}</p>
    </div>
  ))}
</section>
