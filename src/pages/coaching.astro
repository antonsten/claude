        <h3 class="body-xxl mb-24">I've spent the past 25+ years designing apps and websites for companies like Google, Spotify, Loom, IKEA, and Herman Miller. I've worked with big agencies like BBDO and Bates Y&R, teamed up with startups (some you've heard of, most you haven't), published two books, coached over 100 students and designers, and spoken at design schools for more than 15 years.<br /><br />Along the way, I've picked up a few things about design, careers, and how to stay sane while building both.<br /><br />If you're stuck, growing, or just figuring out what's next, here's how I can help:</h3>
