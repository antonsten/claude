    <p class="body-xxl font-serif mb-40">Every day, thousands of new apps, websites, and digital products launch. Most will be forgotten within six months—not because they don't work, but because nobody needed them in the first place.</p>

            <p>There's a practical honesty here, especially in the way the book calls out feature bloat and the tendency to confuse activity with progress. If you're tired of design books that talk in circles, this one actually addresses the work as it is.</p>

            <p>What I like about this book is that it's an easy read that talks about design in a holistic way.</p>
            <p>It's a book I wish I read at the beginning of my career, because it really shows the many facets that make up design and underlines it with personal stories, concrete examples and practical tips.</p>
            <p>Now reading this book further into my career it still is insightful - but also just very relatable and reassuring. Truly a design mentor in book-form.</p>

          <div class="text-sm space-y-4">
            <p>Most design books are written from the sidelines. This one is written from the arena. Anton's Products People Actually Want is built on hard-won lessons from real projects where the stakes were high and the consequences of getting it wrong were huge.</p>
            <p>What makes this book stand out is its honesty. It doesn't dress design up in theory or shiny frameworks. It lays bare the real, messy, human work of building products people care about. I've worked with Anton on high-stakes projects for major brands, and I've seen firsthand how he moves seamlessly from detail to strategy without ever losing sight of the human at the center.</p>
            <p>This book is sharp, grounded, and unflinching - a reminder that success isn't about features, it's about outcomes that matter. Every designer, PM, and founder who reads it will come away changed.</p>
