    <p class="body-xxl mb-12">We're drowning in products nobody wants, built by people who never asked if they should.</p>

    <p class="body-xxl mb-20">Every day, thousands of new apps, websites, and digital products launch. Most will be forgotten within six months—not because they don't work, but because nobody needed them in the first place.</p>
    
    <p class="body-xxl font-semibold mb-8">Introducing...</p>
    
    <h1 class="text-black font-medium text-[48px] leading-[1.2] tracking-[-0.02em] sm:text-display mb-20">Products People Actually Want</h1>

    <p class="body-xxl mb-24">A practical guide to building digital products that solve real problems instead of adding to the noise. Based on 25+ years of experience consulting for companies like IKEA, Herman Miller, Loom, Google, and Spotify, this book covers everything from user research and stakeholder communication to design systems and team leadership.<br><br>Learn how to focus on what users actually need, communicate design decisions effectively, and build products people genuinely want to use.</p>


    <!-- Book Description -->
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-12">This book cuts through the noise</h2>
    
    <p class="body-xxl mb-12">Most design books talk in circles about theory and best practices. This one addresses the work as it is: messy trade-offs, pressure to ship, the challenge of balancing business goals with real user needs.</p>
    
         <p class="body-xxl mb-8"><strong>You'll learn:</strong></p>
    <ul class="body-xxl list-disc list-outside space-y-2 ml-4 mb-12">
      <li>Why "everyone is a designer" and how to leverage diverse perspectives in your team</li>
      <li>The complete product design process that works in the real world, not just in case studies</li>
      <li>How to communicate design decisions and influence stakeholders who "prefer the other option because it looks more modern"</li>
      <li>Practical frameworks for user research that reveal what people actually need (not what they say they want)</li>
      <li>How to design for anyone without falling into the "design for everyone" trap</li>
    </ul>
    
         <p class="body-xxl mb-24"><strong>This isn't another book about making things pretty. It's about understanding humans well enough to build things they actually want.</strong></p>

Anton\'s Products People Actually Want is built on hard-won lessons from real projects where the stakes were high and the consequences of getting it wrong were huge.', 'What makes this book stand out is its honesty. It doesn\'t dress design up in theory or shiny frameworks. It lays bare the real, messy, human work of building products people care about. I\'ve worked with Anton on high-stakes projects for major brands, and I\'ve seen firsthand how he moves seamlessly from detail to strategy without ever losing sight of the human at the center.', 'This book is sharp, grounded, and unflinching - a reminder that success isn\'t about features, it\'s about outcomes that matter.
