    <p class="text-[20px] leading-[32px] font-regular mb-8">With so many wildly successful businesses out there, we are left wondering what they did to get there and how they stay there. Is there a magic bullet? Did they make a deal with the devil? The answer is actually far more simple than you'd imagine. <em>It turns out that they just value their customers by creating great user experiences for them.</em> Whether it's their product, their website, or even their customer service – a business rises or falls on the experience their customers have.</p>

      ))}
    </section>

    <p class="text-[20px] leading-[32px] font-regular mb-8">Let's start by understanding what User Experience really is, what it isn't, and why it matters. Our first chapters will clear these up as I think it's important that we are all on the same page.</p>

    <p class="text-[20px] leading-[32px] font-regular mb-8">One of the virtues I hold dear as a UX Designer is my curiosity about how things work. I've had the opportunity to meet and work with so many talented people that I could likely do an entire book with just interviews.</p>

    <p class="text-[20px] leading-[32px] font-regular mb-8">The book includes interviews with:</p>

    <ul class="text-[20px] leading-[32px] font-regular mb-8 list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      {interviews.map((interview) => (
        <li>{interview}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>

    <p class="text-[20px] leading-[32px] font-regular mb-8">User Experiences are created out of love and a deep desire to make things better. These final chapters will cover just this – the importance of creating something for PEOPLE rather than "users".</p>
