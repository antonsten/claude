        <p class="h3">I've been a younger brother for 44 years, loved dogs for 40, been into music for 35, worked as a designer for 28, supported Liverpool for 26, and lived in Sweden for 23.</p>
        <p class="h3">If you looked only at those numbers, it might seem like not much happened after I turned 20. The truth is the opposite. The last two decades are where almost everything happened — the work I'm proud of, the person I grew into, the life I built.</p>
        <p class="h3">When I'm not designing, I'm usually outside with my wife Anna and our dog, Taylor (Swift), wandering around our old house in the Swedish countryside. It's beautiful and slightly broken, always giving us a new project. I used to find that tiring. Now I find it grounding. Some things aren't meant to be finished; you just live in them.</p>
        <p class="h3">As a designer, I carry the same mindset: curiosity, patience, and the belief that good things are shaped over time.</p>
